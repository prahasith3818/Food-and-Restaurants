### Problem Statement:
* In this project I had created a Food Booking Website . This Food Booking app helps the customer to book food and
search for the right food or the dish they want to order, place their orders and pay easily. 
 
### Problem Description:
* I have created a Food Booking site named Bistros - Restaurant using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT . It helps the customers to book food online. In this website I had added four pages named as Home, About Us, Menu, Contact Us . Customers can go to MENU and select their favorite dishes. If Customers want to book their food they can go to contact us page and order their food by contacting us. Its look like an professional website. I am trying to solve the real world problem like in these days we are searching good and healthy food here and there. So I had created a web app where I had given every dish details. My project helps both the customer and seller Like for seller I created a very beautiful User design that attract customer easily and also helps the customer to get the Food to their doorsteps. The main objective of the Project on Online Food Ordering System is to manage the details of Food Item, Category, Customer, Order, Confirm Order. It manages all the information about Food Item, Payment, Confirm Order, Food Item.
